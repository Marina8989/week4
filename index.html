      <p>With grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in future. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look".</p>
      <img src="img/chair1.png" alt="chair1"/>
      <p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames loung chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>
      <p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approching each project the same way: Does it interest and itrique us? Can we make it better?</p>

      "Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely &amp; to the best of your ability, &amp; that way, you might change the world"<br><span>-Charles Eames</span></p>
      <p>They loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, process and product, style and fub=nction. "The details are not details", said Charles. "They make the product".</p>

       <p>Their own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration," he said, "a kind of 30-year flash".</p>
       <p>A desight critic once said that this extraordinary couple " just wanted to make theh world a better place". That they did. That also made it a lot more interesting.</p>
